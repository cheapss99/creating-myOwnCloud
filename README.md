# Progress 
## Day 1

-I fucked up my whole computer (Well not tottaly but I had to use my backup image file to go back to my working one)

-What happened? I accidentally deleted the whole database and volumes glad it didnt had files yet I tried to redo and get it back to normal working state but I got pissed off and just told myself fuck it I'll start a new one
